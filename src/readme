In IoC, only the objects will be created that will be made through beans in spring.xml

Note: spring.xml is the file configuration we have to maintain
if not using springboot.

<constructor-arg value="20"/>
Above line is constructor injection for age attribute
For it to work, there need to be a parameterized constructor for age in Dev class.

<property name="laptop" ref="lap1"/>
Above line in spring.xml looks for bean named 'lap1', and wires(connects)
it with Dev bean in which it is invoked.
This is setter injection for laptop obj.
For it to work, there need to be setter for the laptop obj in Dev class.
